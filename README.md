# Full-Stack RAG based Report Generating Agent

> **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** is a method that combines information retrieval with large language models to generate answers. Here’s how RAG works on a high level:
>
> 1. The model retrieves relevant data from data sources and then extracts it to a vector database from the pre-indexed model.
> 2. Augment the prompts by retrieving information and merging it with the query prompt.
> 3. A Large Language Model (like GPT, Claude, or Gemini) understands the combined query and generates the final response.
>
> A traditional RAG has a simple retrieval, limited adaptability, and relies on static knowledge, making it less flexible for dynamic and real-time information.

## 🚀 Full-Stack Report Generating Agent

This repository contains a powerful, production-ready full-stack agent designed to generate comprehensive, accurate reports by leveraging advanced Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques. It seamlessly integrates backend data retrieval with state-of-the-art language models, ensuring your reports are always up-to-date and relevant.

### 🔑 Key Features

- **Advanced RAG Implementation:**  
  Combines real-time data retrieval with LLMs for context-rich, precise report generation.

- **Flexible Data Source Support:**  
  Easily connect to multiple data sources (databases, APIs, files, etc.) for maximum adaptability.

- **Scalable Vector Database Integration:**  
  Efficiently indexes and retrieves relevant information for fast, accurate responses.

- **Prompt Augmentation:**  
  Dynamically augments user queries with context from retrieved data, improving LLM performance.

- **Customizable Report Templates:**  
  Define and manage report formats to fit any business requirement.

- **Modern Full-Stack Architecture:**  
  Built using robust backend and frontend technologies for performance and usability.

### 🧩 How RAG is Implemented in This Project

1. **Data Retrieval:**  
   When a user requests a report, the agent fetches relevant data from connected sources and stores embeddings in a vector database.

2. **Prompt Augmentation:**  
   Retrieved content is merged with the user’s query, forming a context-rich prompt.

3. **LLM Integration:**  
   The combined prompt is sent to a large language model (e.g., OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, or Google Gemini) which generates a detailed, accurate report.

4. **Result Delivery:**  
   The final report—augmented with both retrieved facts and model insights—is delivered to the user.

> **Note:** Unlike traditional RAG solutions, this implementation is designed for adaptability and real-time information, ensuring your reports reflect the latest data.

- Start the development server to access the UI.

#### 4. Ingest Data

- Use provided scripts to index your data sources into the vector database.

#### 5. Generate Reports

- Access the web UI, enter your query, and receive an augmented, LLM-generated report.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI/Flask (or your chosen stack)
- **Frontend:** React/Vue (or your chosen stack)
- **Vector Database:** (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, ChromaDB)
- **LLMs:** OpenAI GPT, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, etc.

### 📃 Example Usage

1. **Request:** “Generate a sales summary report for Q1 2025.”
2. **Retrieval:** The agent fetches sales data from connected databases.
3. **Augmentation:** The context is appended to the prompt.
4. **Generation:** LLM produces a natural language summary and insights.
